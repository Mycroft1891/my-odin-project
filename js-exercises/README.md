## HOW TO USE THESE EXERCISES
Before you start you should have a few things installed on your machine:
1. NodeJS.  To check if you have it type `node -v` in a terminal.  If you get back a number bigger than `6` that means you've got it installed.  Best way to install node is with NVM.  Check link for instructions [here](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script)
2. Jasmine.  Jasmine is a testing framework for Javascript.  Type `jasmine -v` to check for it.  If you need to install it type `npm install -g jasmine` to do so.
3. Clone this repo and get started.
